This repository contains two dub-projects :
    1. Lane Detection
    2. Tensorflow object-Detection

The Lane detection algorithm uses opencv and canny edge detction to detect edges and ten track the lanes in real time.
To understand how lane detection algorithm works read this article that explains it properly : https://medium.com/@mrhwick/simple-lane-detection-with-opencv-bfeb6ae54ec0


For tensorflow object detectio api to work you must first install all the dependencies. 
Follow this link for step-by-step tutorial : https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
